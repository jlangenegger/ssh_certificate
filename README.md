# Certificate-based SSH authentication

Certificate-based SSH authentication is superior to SSH keys in many ways:

* SSH certificates intrinsically possess a validity period before and after which they are invalid for providing authentication.
* SSH certificates can be embedded with SSH restrictions that limit:
  * Who can use the certificate
  * The list of available SSH features (X11Forwarding, AgentForwarding, etc)
  * Which SSH client machines can use the certificate
  * Commands that can be run via SSH

## Setup
For the purposes of this repository, let’s consider three systems:
* Certification Authority (CA)
  * System name “ca.netdef.org“
  * Will host our Certification Authority
* Host
  * System name “host.netdef.org“
  * Will function as an SSH server
* Client 
  * System name "client.netdef.org"
  * Will function as an SSH client

## Certificates
There are two different certificates.
* client certificate
  * This certificate is stored on the client and is provided to the host during the ssh connection establishment.
  * It is used on the host side to authenticate the clients that try to login.
* host certificate
  * This certificate is stored on the host and is provided to the client during the ssh connection establishment.
  * It is used on the client side to authenticate the host that the client tries to login.

## Configuration
To configure the client and the host, there are seperate READMEs:
* `./host/README.md`
* `./client/README.md`
